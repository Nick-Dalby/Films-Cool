## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React-Redux, [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

Client side of a movieDB app built with React integrated with a mongoDB backend via a [RESTAPI](https://github.com/Nick-Dalby/movieAPI)
Features:

- user log-in and sign-up forms
- async functions to fetch data using Axios
- React redux, async thunks
- side-panel transitions / responsive styles

## Optimizations

there is scope to implement cacheing, improve transitions on load, improve animations, refactor the implementation of redux

## Lessons Learned / Demonstrations of:

- getting and setting local storage
- async thunk API requests
- React-Redux state management via Redux toolkit
- array mapping and filtering
- react-router routes
- styled-components âœ¨
